## Current State

| Field | Value |

| **Pass gate** | ≥1 stranger starts transformation AND returns |

### Open Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|

| Market domain not outcome | Market **Become Future-Proof**; AI Builder is a path |
| Bulk thin SEO pages | Publish gate: score >= 70 |
